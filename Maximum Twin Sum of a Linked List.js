// In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.

// For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.
// The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

// Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.

// Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
// Output: 6
// Explanation:
// Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
// There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
// Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6.
